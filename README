(10+2)5 OS X Dashboard Widget

A ridiculously simple widget to pace (10+2)*5 work sessions. Tells you when
to "Start" and "Stop" working, and announces the passing hours (always 5
iterations, whether or not you've finished tasks early). 

Punch the button once to start working. If you finish a task early, punch the
button to skip to break. To stop the clock completely, punch the button
during break (i.e., twice if it thinks you’re working).

Uses OS X's speech synthesizer to make inconspicuous announcements, so check
your volume! As of 1.0.2, wee Growl notifications are sent out (thanks, Adam
Wróbel <amw>, for the idea!)
