# Deprecated

This is a very old repository and a project I've frankly lost
interest in. I'm keeping its repo public on GH mostly for
sentimental reasons. There are lots of other Pomodoro timers out
there; I recommend trying one of those instead. :)

# (10+2)5 OS X Dashboard Widget

A ridiculously simple widget to pace (10+2)*5 work sessions. Tells you when
to "Start" and "Stop" working, and announces the passing hours (always 5
iterations, whether or not you've finished tasks early). 

Punch the button once to start working. If you finish a task early, punch the
button to skip to break. To stop the clock completely, punch the button
during break (i.e., twice if it thinks you’re working).

Uses OS X's speech synthesizer to make inconspicuous announcements, so check
your volume! As of 1.0.2, wee Growl notifications are sent out (thanks, Adam
Wróbel <amw>, for the idea!)
