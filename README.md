# Deprecation notice

This is a very old project: I originally wrote it for OS X Tiger. [The widget is still listed on Apple's website,](https://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/developer/1025.html) so I keep the repository around, but there are lots of better Pomodoro timers out there and I recommend using one of those instead.

# (10+2)5 OS X Dashboard Widget

[⬇ Download (~31 KB)](http://fun.redopop.com/1025/1025.wdgt.zip)

A ridiculously simple OS X Dashboard widget to pace (10+2)*5 work sessions. Tells you when to "Start" and "Stop" working, and announces the passing hours (always 5 iterations, whether or not you've finished tasks early).

Punch the button once to start working. If you finish a task early, punch the button to skip to break. To stop the clock completely, punch the button during break (i.e., twice if it thinks you’re working).

Uses OS X's speech synthesizer to make inconspicuous announcements, so check your volume!
