**Deprecation notice:**

This is a very old project; it was built for OS X Tiger! [It's still listed on Apple's website,](https://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/developer/1025.html) so I keep the repo around, but there are lots of better Pomodoro timers out there; I recommend trying one of those instead!

# (10+2)5 OS X Dashboard Widget

[Download](http://fun.redopop.com/1025/1025.wdgt.zip)

A ridiculously simple OS X Dashboard widget to pace (10+2)*5 work sessions. Tells you when to "Start" and "Stop" working, and announces the passing hours (always 5 iterations, whether or not you've finished tasks early).

Punch the button once to start working. If you finish a task early, punch the button to skip to break. To stop the clock completely, punch the button during break (i.e., twice if it thinks youâ€™re working).

Uses OS X's speech synthesizer to make inconspicuous announcements, so check your volume!
